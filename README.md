# 🎯 Word Guessing Game 
This is my first project I have done today.
It is a simple command-line word guessing game built with Python. The player tries to guess the hidden word one letter at a time, with a limited number of attempts. This project is great for practicing string handling, loops, and basic game logic in Python.

# 🛠 Features
.Random word selection from a predefined list

.Tracks guessed letters and remaining attempts

.Displays current progress of the word (e.g., H _ N G M _ N)

.Input validation to handle repeated or invalid guesses

.Simple, clean terminal interface

# ▶️ How to Run
1.Make sure you have Python installed.

2.Clone this repository or download the script.

3.Run the game using:
python word_guess.py

# 🧠 Skills Practiced
.Control flow (if/else, loops)

.Lists and strings

.Functions

.User input handling

.Basic game logic
